            <p>Hello & welcome to my site! My name is Monica Mantilla, I am 24 years old, and I live in Orlando, Florida.</p>
            <p>When I was 13, my family moved from Nicaragua to Omaha, Nebraska. That's where I went to high school and attended the University of Nebraska-Omaha.</p>
            <p>I currently work in the Financial Industry helping people plan for their retirement. But a few months ago, I realized I no longer want to pursue this career path so I started to look for new horizons.</p>
            <p>I consider myself very fortunate to have been accepted into UCF's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I hope to learn the proper skills to aid my career transition.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy exercising, podcasts, and learning new ways to make money.</p>
